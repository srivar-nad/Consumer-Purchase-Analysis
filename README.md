# Consumer-Purchase-Analysis
A statistical analysis exploring how age, gender, product category, subscription status, and purchase history influence consumer purchase behavior using hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and regression.

# 🛒 Consumer Purchase Analysis – Demographics, Product Category & Behavioral Patterns

This project explores how factors like **age, gender, review ratings, location, product category, subscription status,** and **purchase history** influence **purchase frequency and spending** in an e-commerce setting.

Using statistical techniques like **descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, ANOVA**, and **multiple linear regression**, we examined customer behavior and spending across key variables.



## 📊 Project Summary

- **Title**: How Do Review Ratings, Season, Location, Product Category, and Age Influence Purchase Frequency?
- **Tools Used**: R, Excel
- **Methods**: Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, Regression
- **Timeline**: Fall 2023
- **Instructor**: Dr. Rui Sun  
- **Author**: Srikar Varma Nadimpalli



## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Does gender significantly influence purchase amount?
- Do product categories affect how much customers spend?
- What role do age, subscription status, and review ratings play in purchase behavior?



## 🧪 Methods Used

- Descriptive Statistics: Summary tables, mean/std, histograms
- Hypothesis Testing: Two-sample t-test
- ANOVA: One-way ANOVA on purchase amount vs. product category
- Regression: Multiple linear regression using R


## 📌 Conclusion

> The analysis suggests that **conventional demographic and categorical features** do not significantly explain variations in purchase amount. This opens the door for **more granular or behavioral variables** (e.g., brand loyalty, lifestyle, time of year) to better predict consumer behavior.
